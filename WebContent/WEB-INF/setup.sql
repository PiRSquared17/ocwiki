Private schools existed, but only for the very rich. There were very few public schools because of the\r\nstrong sentiment that children who would grow up to be laborers should not &ldquo;waste&rdquo; their time on education\r\nbut should instead prepare themselves for their life&rsquo;s work. It was in the face of this public sentiment that\r\neducational reformers set about their task. Horace Mann, probably the most famous of the reformers, felt that\r\nthere was no excuse in a republic for any citizen to be uneducated. As Superintendent of Education in the state\r\nof Massachusetts from 1837 to 1848, he initiated various changes, which were soon matched in other school\r\ndistricts around the country. He extended the school year from five to six months and improved the quality of\r\nteachers by instituting teacher education and raising teacher salaries. Although these changes did not bring\r\nabout a sudden improvement in the educational system, they at least increased public awareness as to the need\r\nfor a further strengthening of the system.'),

Both are commonly used for lighting and heating\r\ntoday. We now can instantly flick a lighter or strike a match to make a flame. But it was not long ago that\r\nthere were no such things as matches or lighters. To make fire, it was necessary to strike a piece of iron on flint\r\nfor sparks to ignite some tinder. If the tinder was damp, or the flint old, you had to borrow some fire from a\r\nneighbor.\r\nWe do not know exactly when or how people first used fire. Perhaps, many ages ago, they found that sticks\r\nwould burn if they were dropped into some hole where melted lava from a volcano lay boiling. They brought\r\nthe lighted sticks back to make their fire in a cave. Or, they may have seen trees catch fire through being struck\r\nby lightning, and used the trees to start their own fires.\r\nGradually people learned they could start a fire without traveling far to find flames. They rubbed two pieces\r\nof wood together. This method was used for thousands of years.\r\nWhen people became used to making fires with which to cook food and stay warm at night, they found that\r\ncertain resins or gums from trees burnt longer and brighter. They melted resins and dipped branches in the\r\nliquid to make torches that lit their homes at night. Iron stands in which torches used to be fixed can still be\r\nseen in old buildings of Europe.\r\nThere was no lighting in city streets until gas lamps, and then electric lamps were installed. Boys ran about\r\nLondon at night carrying torches of burning material. They were called torch boys, or link boys, and earned a\r\nliving by guiding visitors to friends&rsquo; houses at night.\r\nFor centuries homes were lit by candles until oil was found. Even then, oil lamps were no more effective\r\nthan a cluster of candles.

Charlie Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a reporter who, while interviewing him, happened to describe the working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young farm boys were lured to the city to work on automotive assembly lines. Within four or five years, these young men&rsquo;s health was destroyed by the stress of work in the factories.\r\nThe film opens with a shot of a mass of sheep making their way down a crowded ramp.\r\nAbruptly, the film shifts to a scene of factory workers jostling one another on their way to a factory. However, the rather bitter note of criticism in the implied comparison is not sustained. It is replaced by a gentle note of satire. Chaplin prefers to entertain rather than lecture.\r\nScenes of factory interiors account for only about one-third of Modern Times, but they contain some of the most pointed social commentary as well as the most comic situations. No one who has seen the film can ever forget Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the fast-moving conveyor belt, almost losing his mind in the process. Another popular scene involves an automatic feeding machine brought to the assembly line so that workers need not interrupt their labor to eat. The feeding machine malfunctions, hurling food at Chaplin, who is strapped in his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. This serves to illustrate people&rsquo;s utter helplessness in the face of machines that are meant to serve their basic needs.\r\nClearly, Modern Times has its faults, but it remains the best film treating technology within a social context.

(1321, '<p><strong>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 11 to 20.</strong></p>\r\nVery few people in the modern world obtain their food supply by hunting and gathering in the natural environment surrounding their homes. This method of harvesting from nature&rsquo;s provision is the oldest known subsistence strategy and has been practised for at least the last two million years. It was, indeed, the only way to obtain food until rudimentary farming and the domestication of wild animals were introduced about 10,000 years ago.\r\nBecause hunter-gatherers have fared poorly in comparison with their agricultural cousins, their numbers have dwindled, and they have been forced to live in marginal environments, such as deserts and arctic wastelands. In higher latitudes, the shorter growing seasons have restricted the availability of plant life. Such conditions have caused a greater dependence on hunting, and on fishing along the coasts and waterways. The abundance of vegetation in the lower latitudes of the tropics, on the other hand, has provided a greater opportunity for gathering a variety of plants. In short, the environmental differences have restricted the diet and have limited possibilities for the development of subsistence societies.\r\nContemporary hunter-gatherers may help us understand our prehistoric ancestors. We know from the observation of modern hunter-gatherers in both Africa and Alaska that a society based on hunting and gathering must be very mobile. While the entire community camps in a central location, a smaller party harvests the food within a reasonable distance from the camp. When the food in the area has become exhausted, the community moves on to exploit another site. We also notice seasonal migration patterns evolving for most hunter-gatherers, along with a strict division of labor between the sexes. These patterns of behavior may be similar to those practised by mankind during the Paleolithic Period.'),

Both are commonly used for lighting and heating\r\ntoday. We now can instantly flick a lighter or strike a match to make a flame. But it was not long ago that\r\nthere were no such things as matches or lighters. To make fire, it was necessary to strike a piece of iron on flint\r\nfor sparks to ignite some tinder. If the tinder was damp, or the flint old, you had to borrow some fire from a\r\nneighbor.\r\nWe do not know exactly when or how people first used fire. Perhaps, many ages ago, they found that sticks\r\nwould burn if they were dropped into some hole where melted lava from a volcano lay boiling. They brought\r\nthe lighted sticks back to make their fire in a cave. Or, they may have seen trees catch fire through being struck\r\nby lightning, and used the trees to start their own fires.\r\nGradually people learned they could start a fire without traveling far to find flames. They rubbed two pieces\r\nof wood together. This method was used for thousands of years.\r\nWhen people became used to making fires with which to cook food and stay warm at night, they found that\r\ncertain resins or gums from trees burnt longer and brighter. They melted resins and dipped branches in the\r\nliquid to make torches that lit their homes at night. Iron stands in which torches used to be fixed can still be\r\nseen in old buildings of Europe.\r\nThere was no lighting in city streets until gas lamps, and then electric lamps were installed. Boys ran about\r\nLondon at night carrying torches of burning material. They were called torch boys, or link boys, and earned a\r\nliving by guiding visitors to friends&rsquo; houses at night.\r\nFor centuries homes were lit by candles until oil was found. Even then, oil lamps were no more effective\r\nthan a cluster of candles. We read about the splendors and marvels of ancient palaces and castles, but we\r\nforget that they must have been gloomy and murky places at night.'),

Private schools existed, but only for the very rich. There were very few public schools because of the\r\nstrong sentiment that children who would grow up to be laborers should not &ldquo;waste&rdquo; their time on education\r\nbut should instead prepare themselves for their life&rsquo;s work. It was in the face of this public sentiment that\r\neducational reformers set about their task. Horace Mann, probably the most famous of the reformers, felt that\r\nthere was no excuse in a republic for any citizen to be uneducated. As Superintendent of Education in the state\r\nof Massachusetts from 1837 to 1848, he initiated various changes, which were soon matched in other school\r\ndistricts around the country. He extended the school year from five to six months and improved the quality of\r\nteachers by instituting teacher education and raising teacher salaries. Although these changes did not bring\r\nabout a sudden improvement in the educational system, they at least increased public awareness as to the need\r\nfor a further strengthening of the system.'),

It was in the face of this public sentiment that\r\neducational reformers set about their task. Horace Mann, probably the most famous of the reformers, felt that\r\nthere was no excuse in a republic for any citizen to be uneducated. As Superintendent of Education in the state\r\nof Massachusetts from 1837 to 1848, he initiated various changes, which were soon matched in other school\r\ndistricts around the country. He extended the school year from five to six months and improved the quality of\r\nteachers by instituting teacher education and raising teacher salaries.

Both are commonly used for lighting and heating\r\ntoday. We now can instantly flick a lighter or strike a match to make a flame. But it was not long ago that\r\nthere were no such things as matches or lighters. To make fire, it was necessary to strike a piece of iron on flint\r\nfor sparks to ignite some tinder. If the tinder was damp, or the flint old, you had to borrow some fire from a\r\nneighbor.\r\nWe do not know exactly when or how people first used fire. Perhaps, many ages ago, they found that sticks\r\nwould burn if they were dropped into some hole where melted lava from a volcano lay boiling. They brought\r\nthe lighted sticks back to make their fire in a cave. Or, they may have seen trees catch fire through being struck\r\nby lightning, and used the trees to start their own fires.\r\nGradually people learned they could start a fire without traveling far to find flames. They rubbed two pieces\r\nof wood together. This method was used for thousands of years.\r\nWhen people became used to making fires with which to cook food and stay warm at night, they found that\r\ncertain resins or gums from trees burnt longer and brighter. They melted resins and dipped branches in the\r\nliquid to make torches that lit their homes at night. Iron stands in which torches used to be fixed can still be\r\nseen in old buildings of Europe.\r\nThere was no lighting in city streets until gas lamps, and then electric lamps were installed. Boys ran about\r\nLondon at night carrying torches of burning material. They were called torch boys, or link boys, and earned a\r\nliving by guiding visitors to friends&rsquo; houses at night.\r\nFor centuries homes were lit by candles until oil was found. Even then, oil lamps were no more effective\r\nthan a cluster of candles. We read about the splendors and marvels of ancient palaces and castles, but we\r\nforget that they must have been gloomy and murky places at night.'),

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several European nations<strong> instituted</strong> public-welfare programs.

Paid for by deductions from the paychecks of working people, Social Security ensures that retired persons receive a modest monthly income and also provides unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and other assistance to those who need it. Social Security payments to retired persons can start at age 62, but many wait until age 65, when the payments are slightly higher. Recently, there has been oncern that the Social</p>\r\n<p>Security fund may not have enough money to fulfill its obligations in the 21st century, when the population of elderly Americans is expected to increase dramatically. Policy makers have proposed various ways to make up the anticipated deficit, but a long-term solution is still being debated.</p>\r\n<p>In the years since Roosevelt, other American presidents have established assistance programs.

In many places, it is actually considered unusual not to use one. In many\r\ncountries, cellphones are very popular with young people. They find that the phones are more than a means of\r\ncommunication - having a mobile phone shows that they are cool and connected.\r\nThe explosion in mobile phone use around the world has made some health professionals worried. Some doctors are\r\nconcerned that in the future many people may suffer health problems from the use of mobile phones. In England, there has\r\nbeen a serious debate about this issue. Mobile phone companies are worried about the negative publicity of such ideas.\r\nThey say that there is no proof that mobile phones are bad for your health.\r\nOn the other hand, medical studies have shown changes in the brain cells of some people who use mobile phones.\r\nSigns of change in the tissues of the brain and head can be detected with modern scanning equipment. In one case, a\r\ntraveling salesman had to retire at young age because of serious memory loss. He couldn''t remember even simple tasks.\r\nHe would often forget the name of his own son. This man used to talk on his mobile phone for about six hours a day, every\r\nday of his working week, for a couple of years. His family doctor blamed his mobile phone use, but his employer''s doctor\r\ndidn''t agree.\r\nWhat is it that makes mobile phones potentially harmful? The answer is radiation. High-tech machines can detect very\r\nsmall amounts of radiation from mobile phones. Mobile phone companies agree that there is some radiation, but they say\r\nthe amount is too small to worry about.\r\nAs the discussion about their safety continues, it appears that it''s best to use mobile phones less often. Use your\r\nregular phone if you want to talk for a long time. Use your mobile phone only when you really need it. Mobile phones can\r\nbe very useful and convenient, especially in emergencies. In the future, mobile phones may have a warning label that says\r\nthey are bad for your health. So for now, it''s wise not to use your mobile phone too often.'),

Arriving immigrants depended mainly on predecessors from their homeland to help them start a new life. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several European nations<strong> instituted</strong> public-welfare programs.

Paid for by deductions from the paychecks of working people, Social Security ensures that retired persons receive a modest monthly income and also provides unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and other assistance to those who need it. Social Security payments to retired persons can start at age 62, but many wait until age 65, when the payments are slightly higher. Recently, there has been oncern that the Social</p>\r\n<p>Security fund may not have enough money to fulfill its obligations in the 21st century, when the population of elderly Americans is expected to increase dramatically. Policy makers have proposed various ways to make up the anticipated deficit, but a long-term solution is still being debated.</p>\r\n<p>In the years since Roosevelt, other American presidents have established assistance programs. These include Medicaid and Medicare; food stamps, certificates that people can use to purchase food; and public housing which is built at federal expense and made available to persons on low incomes.</p>\r\n<p>Needy Americans can also turn to sources other than the government for help.

Arriving immigrants depended mainly on predecessors from their homeland to help them start a new life. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several European nations<strong> instituted</strong> public-welfare programs. But such a movement was slow to take hold in the United States because the rapid pace of industrialization and the ready availability of farmland seemed to confirm the belief that anyone who was willing to work could find a job.</p>\r\n<p>Most of the programs started during the Depression era were temporary relief measures, but one of the programs - Social Security - has become an American institution. Paid for by deductions from the paychecks of working people, Social Security ensures that retired persons receive a modest monthly income and also provides unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and other assistance to those who need it. Social Security payments to retired persons can start at age 62, but many wait until age 65, when the payments are slightly higher. Recently, there has been oncern that the Social</p>\r\n<p>Security fund may not have enough money to fulfill its obligations in the 21st century, when the population of elderly Americans is expected to increase dramatically. Policy makers have proposed various ways to make up the anticipated deficit, but a long-term solution is still being debated.</p>\r\n<p>In the years since Roosevelt, other American presidents have established assistance programs. These include Medicaid and Medicare; food stamps, certificates that people can use to purchase food; and public housing which is built at federal expense and made available to persons on low incomes.</p>\r\n<p>Needy Americans can also turn to sources other than the government for help. A broad spectrum of private charities and voluntary organizations is available. Volunteerism is on the rise in the United States, especially among retired persons.</p>\r\n<p>It is estimated that almost 50 percent of Americans over age 18 do volunteer work, and nearly 75 percent of U.S. households contribute money to charity.'),

In many places, it is actually considered unusual not to use one. In many\r\ncountries, cellphones are very popular with young people. They find that the phones are more than a means of\r\ncommunication - having a mobile phone shows that they are cool and connected.\r\nThe explosion in mobile phone use around the world has made some health professionals worried. Some doctors are\r\nconcerned that in the future many people may suffer health problems from the use of mobile phones. In England, there has\r\nbeen a serious debate about this issue. Mobile phone companies are worried about the negative publicity of such ideas.\r\nThey say that there is no proof that mobile phones are bad for your health.\r\nOn the other hand, medical studies have shown changes in the brain cells of some people who use mobile phones.\r\nSigns of change in the tissues of the brain and head can be detected with modern scanning equipment. In one case, a\r\ntraveling salesman had to retire at young age because of serious memory loss. He couldn''t remember even simple tasks.\r\nHe would often forget the name of his own son. This man used to talk on his mobile phone for about six hours a day, every\r\nday of his working week, for a couple of years. His family doctor blamed his mobile phone use, but his employer''s doctor\r\ndidn''t agree.\r\nWhat is it that makes mobile phones potentially harmful? The answer is radiation. High-tech machines can detect very\r\nsmall amounts of radiation from mobile phones. Mobile phone companies agree that there is some radiation, but they say\r\nthe amount is too small to worry about.\r\nAs the discussion about their safety continues, it appears that it''s best to use mobile phones less often. Use your\r\nregular phone if you want to talk for a long time. Use your mobile phone only when you really need it. Mobile phones can\r\nbe very useful and convenient, especially in emergencies. In the future, mobile phones may have a warning label that says\r\nthey are bad for your health. So for now, it''s wise not to use your mobile phone too often.'),

Charlie Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a reporter who, while interviewing him, happened to describe the working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young farm boys were lured to the city to work on automotive assembly lines. Within four or five years, these young men&rsquo;s health was destroyed by the stress of work in the factories.\r\nThe film opens with a shot of a mass of sheep making their way down a crowded ramp.\r\nAbruptly, the film shifts to a scene of factory workers jostling one another on their way to a factory. However, the rather bitter note of criticism in the implied comparison is not sustained. It is replaced by a gentle note of satire. Chaplin prefers to entertain rather than lecture.\r\nScenes of factory interiors account for only about one-third of Modern Times, but they contain some of the most pointed social commentary as well as the most comic situations. No one who has seen the film can ever forget Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the fast-moving conveyor belt, almost losing his mind in the process. Another popular scene involves an automatic feeding machine brought to the assembly line so that workers need not interrupt their labor to eat. The feeding machine malfunctions, hurling food at Chaplin, who is strapped in his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. This serves to illustrate people&rsquo;s utter helplessness in the face of machines that are meant to serve their basic needs.\r\nClearly, Modern Times has its faults, but it remains the best film treating technology within a social context. It does not offer a radical social message, but it does accurately reflect the sentiment of many who feel they are victims of an over-mechanised world.'),
(1530, '<p><strong>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 11 to 20.</strong></p>\r\nVery few people in the modern world obtain their food supply by hunting and gathering in the natural environment surrounding their homes. This method of harvesting from nature&rsquo;s provision is the oldest known subsistence strategy and has been practised for at least the last two million years. It was, indeed, the only way to obtain food until rudimentary farming and the domestication of wild animals were introduced about 10,000 years ago.\r\nBecause hunter-gatherers have fared poorly in comparison with their agricultural cousins, their numbers have dwindled, and they have been forced to live in marginal environments, such as deserts and arctic wastelands. In higher latitudes, the shorter growing seasons have restricted the availability of plant life. Such conditions have caused a greater dependence on hunting, and on fishing along the coasts and waterways. The abundance of vegetation in the lower latitudes of the tropics, on the other hand, has provided a greater opportunity for gathering a variety of plants. In short, the environmental differences have restricted the diet and have limited possibilities for the development of subsistence societies.\r\nContemporary hunter-gatherers may help us understand our prehistoric ancestors. We know from the observation of modern hunter-gatherers in both Africa and Alaska that a society based on hunting and gathering must be very mobile. While the entire community camps in a central location, a smaller party harvests the food within a reasonable distance from the camp. When the food in the area has become exhausted, the community moves on to exploit another site. We also notice seasonal migration patterns evolving for most hunter-gatherers, along with a strict division of labor between the sexes. These patterns of behavior may be similar to those practised by mankind during the Paleolithic Period.'),

Charlie Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a reporter who, while interviewing him, happened to describe the working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young farm boys were lured to the city to work on automotive assembly lines. Within four or five years, these young men&rsquo;s health was destroyed by the stress of work in the factories.\r\nThe film opens with a shot of a mass of sheep making their way down a crowded ramp.\r\nAbruptly, the film shifts to a scene of factory workers jostling one another on their way to a factory. However, the rather bitter note of criticism in the implied comparison is not sustained. It is replaced by a gentle note of satire. Chaplin prefers to entertain rather than lecture.\r\nScenes of factory interiors account for only about one-third of Modern Times, but they contain some of the most pointed social commentary as well as the most comic situations. No one who has seen the film can ever forget Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the fast-moving conveyor belt, almost losing his mind in the process. Another popular scene involves an automatic feeding machine brought to the assembly line so that workers need not interrupt their labor to eat. The feeding machine malfunctions, hurling food at Chaplin, who is strapped in his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. This serves to illustrate people&rsquo;s utter helplessness in the face of machines that are meant to serve their basic needs.\r\nClearly, Modern Times has its faults, but it remains the best film treating technology within a social context. It does not offer a radical social message, but it does accurately reflect the sentiment of many who feel they are victims of an over-mechanised world.'),
(1556, '<p><strong>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 11 to 20.</strong></p>\r\nVery few people in the modern world obtain their food supply by hunting and gathering in the natural environment surrounding their homes. This method of harvesting from nature&rsquo;s provision is the oldest known subsistence strategy and has been practised for at least the last two million years. It was, indeed, the only way to obtain food until rudimentary farming and the domestication of wild animals were introduced about 10,000 years ago.\r\nBecause hunter-gatherers have fared poorly in comparison with their agricultural cousins, their numbers have dwindled, and they have been forced to live in marginal environments, such as deserts and arctic wastelands. In higher latitudes, the shorter growing seasons have restricted the availability of plant life. Such conditions have caused a greater dependence on hunting, and on fishing along the coasts and waterways. The abundance of vegetation in the lower latitudes of the tropics, on the other hand, has provided a greater opportunity for gathering a variety of plants. In short, the environmental differences have restricted the diet and have limited possibilities for the development of subsistence societies.\r\nContemporary hunter-gatherers may help us understand our prehistoric ancestors. We know from the observation of modern hunter-gatherers in both Africa and Alaska that a society based on hunting and gathering must be very mobile. While the entire community camps in a central location, a smaller party harvests the food within a reasonable distance from the camp. When the food in the area has become exhausted, the community moves on to exploit another site. We also notice seasonal migration patterns evolving for most hunter-gatherers, along with a strict division of labor between the sexes. These patterns of behavior may be similar to those practised by mankind during the Paleolithic Period.'),

Some doctors are\r\nconcerned that in the future many people may suffer health problems from the use of mobile phones. In England, there has\r\nbeen a serious debate about this issue. Mobile phone companies are worried about the negative publicity of such ideas.\r\nThey say that there is no proof that mobile phones are bad for your health.\r\nOn the other hand, medical studies have shown changes in the brain cells of some people who use mobile phones.\r\nSigns of change in the tissues of the brain and head can be detected with modern scanning equipment. In one case, a\r\ntraveling salesman had to retire at young age because of serious memory loss. He couldn''t remember even simple tasks.\r\nHe would often forget the name of his own son. This man used to talk on his mobile phone for about six hours a day, every\r\nday of his working week, for a couple of years. His family doctor blamed his mobile phone use, but his employer''s doctor\r\ndidn''t agree.\r\nWhat is it that makes mobile phones potentially harmful? The answer is radiation. High-tech machines can detect very\r\nsmall amounts of radiation from mobile phones. Mobile phone companies agree that there is some radiation, but they say\r\nthe amount is too small to worry about.\r\nAs the discussion about their safety continues, it appears that it''s best to use mobile phones less often. Use your\r\nregular phone if you want to talk for a long time. Use your mobile phone only when you really need it. Mobile phones can\r\nbe very useful and convenient, especially in emergencies. In the future, mobile phones may have a warning label that says\r\nthey are bad for your health. So for now, it''s wise not to use your mobile phone too often.'),

Private schools existed, but only for the very rich. There were very few public schools because of the\r\nstrong sentiment that children who would grow up to be laborers should not &ldquo;waste&rdquo; their time on education\r\nbut should instead prepare themselves for their life&rsquo;s work. It was in the face of this public sentiment that\r\neducational reformers set about their task. Horace Mann, probably the most famous of the reformers, felt that\r\nthere was no excuse in a republic for any citizen to be uneducated. As Superintendent of Education in the state\r\nof Massachusetts from 1837 to 1848, he initiated various changes, which were soon matched in other school\r\ndistricts around the country. He extended the school year from five to six months and improved the quality of\r\nteachers by instituting teacher education and raising teacher salaries. Although these changes did not bring\r\nabout a sudden improvement in the educational system, they at least increased public awareness as to the need\r\nfor a further strengthening of the system.'),

Both are commonly used for lighting and heating\r\ntoday. We now can instantly flick a lighter or strike a match to make a flame. But it was not long ago that\r\nthere were no such things as matches or lighters. To make fire, it was necessary to strike a piece of iron on flint\r\nfor sparks to ignite some tinder. If the tinder was damp, or the flint old, you had to borrow some fire from a\r\nneighbor.\r\nWe do not know exactly when or how people first used fire. Perhaps, many ages ago, they found that sticks\r\nwould burn if they were dropped into some hole where melted lava from a volcano lay boiling. They brought\r\nthe lighted sticks back to make their fire in a cave. Or, they may have seen trees catch fire through being struck\r\nby lightning, and used the trees to start their own fires.\r\nGradually people learned they could start a fire without traveling far to find flames. They rubbed two pieces\r\nof wood together. This method was used for thousands of years.\r\nWhen people became used to making fires with which to cook food and stay warm at night, they found that\r\ncertain resins or gums from trees burnt longer and brighter. They melted resins and dipped branches in the\r\nliquid to make torches that lit their homes at night. Iron stands in which torches used to be fixed can still be\r\nseen in old buildings of Europe.\r\nThere was no lighting in city streets until gas lamps, and then electric lamps were installed. Boys ran about\r\nLondon at night carrying torches of burning material. They were called torch boys, or link boys, and earned a\r\nliving by guiding visitors to friends&rsquo; houses at night.\r\nFor centuries homes were lit by candles until oil was found. Even then, oil lamps were no more effective\r\nthan a cluster of candles. We read about the splendors and marvels of ancient palaces and castles, but we\r\nforget that they must have been gloomy and murky places at night.'),

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several European nations<strong> instituted</strong> public-welfare programs.

Charlie Chaplin was motivated to make the film by a reporter who, while interviewing him, happened to describe the working conditions in industrial Detroit. Chaplin was told that healthy young farm boys were lured to the city to work on automotive assembly lines. Within four or five years, these young men&rsquo;s health was destroyed by the stress of work in the factories.\r\nThe film opens with a shot of a mass of sheep making their way down a crowded ramp.\r\nAbruptly, the film shifts to a scene of factory workers jostling one another on their way to a factory. However, the rather bitter note of criticism in the implied comparison is not sustained. It is replaced by a gentle note of satire. Chaplin prefers to entertain rather than lecture.\r\nScenes of factory interiors account for only about one-third of Modern Times, but they contain some of the most pointed social commentary as well as the most comic situations. No one who has seen the film can ever forget Chaplin vainly trying to keep pace with the fast-moving conveyor belt, almost losing his mind in the process. Another popular scene involves an automatic feeding machine brought to the assembly line so that workers need not interrupt their labor to eat. The feeding machine malfunctions, hurling food at Chaplin, who is strapped in his position on the assembly line and cannot escape. This serves to illustrate people&rsquo;s utter helplessness in the face of machines that are meant to serve their basic needs.\r\nClearly, Modern Times has its faults, but it remains the best film treating technology within a social context. It does not offer a radical social message, but it does accurately reflect the sentiment of many who feel they are victims of an over-mechanised world.'),
(1591, '<p><strong>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 11 to 20.</strong></p>\r\nVery few people in the modern world obtain their food supply by hunting and gathering in the natural environment surrounding their homes. This method of harvesting from nature&rsquo;s provision is the oldest known subsistence strategy and has been practised for at least the last two million years. It was, indeed, the only way to obtain food until rudimentary farming and the domestication of wild animals were introduced about 10,000 years ago.\r\nBecause hunter-gatherers have fared poorly in comparison with their agricultural cousins, their numbers have dwindled, and they have been forced to live in marginal environments, such as deserts and arctic wastelands. In higher latitudes, the shorter growing seasons have restricted the availability of plant life. Such conditions have caused a greater dependence on hunting, and on fishing along the coasts and waterways. The abundance of vegetation in the lower latitudes of the tropics, on the other hand, has provided a greater opportunity for gathering a variety of plants. In short, the environmental differences have restricted the diet and have limited possibilities for the development of subsistence societies.\r\nContemporary hunter-gatherers may help us understand our prehistoric ancestors. We know from the observation of modern hunter-gatherers in both Africa and Alaska that a society based on hunting and gathering must be very mobile. While the entire community camps in a central location, a smaller party harvests the food within a reasonable distance from the camp. When the food in the area has become exhausted, the community moves on to exploit another site. We also notice seasonal migration patterns evolving for most hunter-gatherers, along with a strict division of labor between the sexes. These patterns of behavior may be similar to those practised by mankind during the Paleolithic Period.'),
